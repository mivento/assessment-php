# PHP Developer Challenge

Developers need to write a PHP script to properly import the CSV file into the MySQL database.
Developers are free to choose any PHP library and framework. They can also write this script in vanilla PHP.

We expect you to finish this assessment in three days.

You can download the sample code and CSV file here:

**Import rules:**
- Developers will create a table schema for the CSV file. SQL dump of table structure should also be pushed with the final code.
- CSV file has 6 fields including name, surname, email, employee_id, phone, and points. Email, phone, and employee_id fields are unique. Therefore, the script needs to check if duplicate records exist.
- Email and Phone fields need to be valid. Their formats should be like this: xx@xx.xxx and 5551234567

**Plus:**
- Showing the result of the import function (success or failure) in the UI is a plus.
- Developers can improve supplied code and add any functionality like Ajax, error handling, etc... This is a big plus.
- Adding a README file and writing instructions on how to run the project is a plus.

Developers need to deploy the final project to any host such as Heroku or shared hosting, push the code to GitHub or Bitbucket, etc. and send the related links to [development@mivento.com](mailto:development@mivento.com "development@mivento.com").
